# PayCost

### Disclaimer:

This repo was created in response to a coding challenge given to me by Palocity. With a timeframe of 8 hours, this project is not expected to be fully polished and ready for production. Thus, there may be a few missing components and edge case bugs.

### Challenge Description:

- Business Need: Ability to pay employee's benefits package. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Please demonstrate how you would code the following scenario:
    - The cost of benefits is $1000/yr for each employee
    - Each dependent (children/spouse) incurs a cost of $500/yr
    - Anyone whose name starts with 'A' gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent
    - We'd like to see this calculation used in an application where employers input employees and their dependents, and get a preview of the costs. This is of course a contrived example. We want to know how you would implement the application structure and calculations and get a brief preview of how you work.
- Assumptions:
    - Free to use whatever technologies you prefer but please be prepared to discuss the choices you've made. We encourage you to focus on creating a logical and functional solution rather than one that is completely polished and ready for production.
    - All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
    - There are 26 paychecks in a year
    - Do not spend more than 8 hours on this challenge

### Thoughts and Opinions:

This coding challenge is something new to me that I have not had in my previous interviews thus far. I appreciate and respect the approach to giving a coding challenge as apposed to whiteboard problems because this exemplifies a more likely scenario found within a typical job. The coding challenge itself was not too easy but also not too hard to where it was out of the scope of my capabilities. I thought that the challenge had the perfect level of difficulty for someone entering the workforce as an entry-level software developer. Overall, I am satisfied with the interviews process thus far.
